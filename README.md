This is a sample README file.
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) widely used in software development for tracking changes in source code during the development process. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git has become the de facto standard for version control due to its speed, flexibility, and powerful branching and merging capabilities.
